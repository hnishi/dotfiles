# hnishi's dotfiles

I aim to make my dotfiles simple, minimal, and dependent only on bash.

## Requirements

- bash
- curl

## How to install

```
curl -L raw.githubusercontent.com/hnishi/dotfiles/master/scripts/download.sh | bash
```

or

```
git clone https://github.com/hnishi/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles/scripts
bash install.sh
```
